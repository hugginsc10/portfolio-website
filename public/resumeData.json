    "bio": "I was born and raised on Long Island, NY.  I went to The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina where I studied accounting and economics.  This was my first introduction to programming.  After working in finance for a couple years I saw how inefficient some of the processes were and decided to research ways to automate them utilizing Python.  I fell in love with programming and have since  then taught myself JavaScript, ReactJs, Redux, Apollo, Ruby on Rails, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.  The ability to create anything that you can imagine is very powerful.  In my free time I love to travel, work on side projects and spend time with my puppy Skye.",
